As India goes to the polls, it is impossible to avoid the wealth of AI-generated content being created - from campaign videos, to personalized audio messages in a range of Indian languages, and even automated calls made to voters in a candidate's voice.

Just over the border in Pakistan, it allowed jailed politician Imran Khan to address a rally.

Then, on 29 April, Prime Minister Modi raised concerns about AI being used to distort speeches by senior leaders of the ruling party, including him.

In the absence of regulation, creators told the BBC they have to rely on personal ethics to decide the kind of work they choose to do or not do.

  

Politicians including US President Joe Biden and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have found themselves **victims of deep fakes**. 

AI is part of our lives. We can’t pass ourselves from them.

44% of people think that they don’t use Ai at all.

85% US adults are online everyday.

But many economists and officials seem dubious that A.I. -- especially generative A.I., which is still in its infancy -- has spread enough to show up in productivity data already.

Companies are using A.I. and generative A.I. for everything from writing marketing emails to helping set prices to answering employees' human resources and legal questions.

Instagram is filling up with A.I.-generated models, Spotify with A.I.-generated songs. Publish a book? Soon after, on Amazon there will often appear A.I.-generated ''workbooks'' for sale that supposedly accompany your book.

**Top Google search results are now often A.I.-generated images or articles.**

There's so much synthetic garbage on the internet now that A.I. companies and researchers are themselves worried, not about the health of the culture, but about what's going to happen with their models.
